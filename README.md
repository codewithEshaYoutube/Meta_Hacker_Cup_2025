## Overview

**Meta Hacker Cup** is a global annual competition organized by **Meta (Facebook)**, designed to identify top algorithmic problem solvers through high-level programming and data structure challenges.

I successfully advanced through:
- Practice Round  
- Round 1  
- **Qualified for Round 2**, placing within the **top 3% globally** among thousands of participants worldwide.
